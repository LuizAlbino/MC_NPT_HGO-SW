These are the files for a program of Monte Carlo Simulations of Anisotropic Systems on Isobaric-Isothermal Ensemble (NPT). They were developed during 2020 - 2021 under the supervision of Prof. PhD Luis Fernando Mercier Franco at School of Chemical Engineering - Unicamp - Brazil.


Some important details before you start:

1. The potencial model used for simulations is derived from Barker-Handeron Perturbation Theory Hard Gaussion Overlaps as reference system and the Square-Well potencial as perturbation system. Main reference: MODELING NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES: MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS AND EQUATIONS OF STATE BASED ON PERTURBATION THEORY. Joyce T. Lopes (2020).

2. All units must be reduced: position/distances --> σ_s , energy --> ε. A quick guide to reducing units can be found at  APPENDIX B.1 - Computer of Simulation of Liquids, Allen & Tildesley, 2nd edition, 2017.

3. Some comments are in portuguese, others in English, sorry for the mess, i'll try to put them all in english soon.

4. This work was developed during my undergrad course, feel free to suggest corrections, programming tips, improvements or new approachs, i'll appreciate all of them :D.

Any questions, I am open to messages.
